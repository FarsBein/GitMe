To change the theme from black-yellow to darkBlue-brightBlue (#1c2237) or green (success and #1DB954):
    1. change the button in Home and steps from waning to primary
    2. change the styling in Home.css to : box-shadow: 1px 1px 20px 1px #1c2237; 

I changed all development URLs:
    1. http://localhost:8000 -> https://jl9fu2pz4g.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/ -> https://git-me-to.herokuapp.com/
    2. http://localhost:3000 -> https://admiring-bose-672fd3.netlify.app/
